### 00:00 (Morning Day 1)

- Detective Karin Parke walks home, entering her apartment.
- Turns on the news, where a controversial story about Disability Benefits is being covered. A News Columnist - Jo Powers - is taking backlash for unpopular views on the law/actions of a "wheelchair Martyr." 20,000 people have signed a petition for her resignation.
- Following Jo on her walk home:

  - Pedestrians insult Jo on her walk home, for her writings. As she arrives at her apartment, she recieves a cake delivery.
- Inside, Jo finds the cake has been frosted with "Fucking Bitch." Her and her husbands frustrations with the matter are evident.

That night:

- Jo is browsing the computer, looking at comments on her article. Most comments and twitter notifications are copious amounts of hate.
  - It is here the "#DeathTo" tweet is first seen, but not made a point of
  - It is also here the window is revealed to be slightly open - an entry point for a bee.
- Karin is watching the news (still?), where performer "Tusk" is introduced in a segment.
  - After being a shown of a young fan mimicing his work, Tusk pokes fun at him (becoming excessively negative)
- Karin is called to the scene of a crime - Jo Powers is dead.
  - Here she meets Blue Colson, Karin's Shadow/Sidekick and Nick Shelton (Part of detectives).
- After discussing who she is (and the horrible article she wrote), even Nick admits to signing the petition to get her sacked. Called it "Clickbait" article.
- Team explores the murder scene, noting struggle and a wounded husband whose unconscience.
  - Twitter mentions are still rolling in on her computer
  - The CCTV codes are being accessed; All entry points appear secure, however.
- As leaving the apartment, Blue notes not having a Driver's License and is "waiting for driverless to go mainstream."
- On the ride home, Blue talks about her previous work in Tech Crimes

  - Blue says "these things (phones) absorb us, they know everything about us."
  - Blue left forensics due to seeing child torturing and murdering photos/videos.

## 13:30 (Morning Day 2)

- News on reporting on Jo's Death. The ticker has a headline "ECHR rules 'cookies' have human rights"
- Reviewing CCTV; no one came in or out. Rear one is broken though.
- Blue searches aggressive tweats on Twitter using an advance(ish) search engine.
  - Karin: "That internet stuff drifts off like weather, it's Half-Hate, they don't mean it. They hate in a marriage, that's 3D, ..., that's sincere"
- Husband wakes up; they go visit.
  - Describes her thrashing at her head, seizing. Smashing her own head & cutting her own throat.
  - Couldn't get her to stop.
- Blue believes the cake may have been at fault; or something else. Thinks he's not the type.
- Karin agrees to go after Blue's lead: an elementary teacher who sent the cake.
  - Blue looks up her social media along the way and points out she said "#DeathTo JoPowers"
- The teacher:
  - Did not pay for the expensive cake, she crowd sourced the money from a message board.
  - Said it was for her sister, to get the bakery to make it.
  - Justifies her actions for the horrible writings of Jo
  - Claims to be using her "Freedom of Speech" (Karin: "To send a threatening message...)
    - "It was funny...". Blue claims she wished Jo Dead, showing her the tweet. The Teacher responds saying that's not real, its a HashTag, a joke thing. Insert the name of someone whose being an asshole...
- Give the teacher a "Caution" on the basis of the "Offensive Communications Act".
  - Clearly not well enforced. Teacher asks if the others of the cake will be punished. Teacher says she didn't do anything. Karin tells her to start a thread about it.

That after noon:

- Karin: "We're arresting the husband, don't wallow in that. The internet will be pissed at someone else today."
  - Tusk is the new target on twitter. More hate and #DeathTo.

That night:

- Tusk backstage of performance
- Camera watching as he's about to smoke marijuana; was about to freak but it's legal.
  - "Kinda takes the joy out of it"
- Tusk attacked. Symptoms of Jo.
- At hospital an ADI is pulled from his head while in the MRI, killing him.
- Shaun Li of the National Crime Agency is introduced, inspecting Tusk's dead body and the ADI.

## 27:00 (Morning Day 3)

- Karin and Blue visit autopsy to find an ADI that had bored into Jo.
  - Attacked the Brain's Pain center causing dire agony; enough to do anything to stop it.
- Visit the Company making ADIs, bankrolled by Gov't. Blue says people online are weary of it, thinking the bees are spying on them. Karin denies it "There's a scizophraic world view".
- Tour the facility, showcasing the Bee's in a large warehouse pollinating plants.
  - Introduced to Rasmus (CEO), explaining colony collapse disorder. They don't know the cause so the bees are designed to fill in the gaps.
  - Reveal ADI may have caused a Death.
- Rasmus examines the ADI from Jo - "These are not designed to kill." When the malfunction they just break and hit the ground.
  - Blue "what if someone hacks", Rasmus: "Militray grade encryption" "Need a diagnostic tool."
- Rasmus shows them the bee traffic control center:
  - 4,000 Bee's per hive, can see where any of the Hives and Bees are. Can search anywhere in the world. Have all the logs of where, when, and what.
  - Bees need to swap between hive jurisdictions; someone spoofed a hive perhaps.
  - Must be within 10-20 meters to do this.
- Can't shutdown the ADIs without Gov't Approval and risk of ecological disaster.

## 35:00 (Afternoon Day 3)

- Karin says should go to NCA at this point, but doesn't want to give them the case. That is where Shaun Li appears - revealing the second death (Tusk).
- Both victims of "online shitstorms" (Fire storms)
- Karin: "There's not fingerprints, no DNA, it's like wishing them dead."
- Blue finds out HashTag came from a bot to seed the HashTag.
  - Introduction to the "Game of Consequences": Bot account links a video saying tweet #DeathTo and an image & name of someone you don't like. If that person is picked enough, then that's the target to be eliminated at 5pm.
  - Determines the next victim by looking at top mentions for the Tag. Discover "Clara Meades" who had posted a disrepectiful image in front of a war memorial. Since Tusk isn't public yet, people don't realize the tweet is real; they are scaring her.
- Blue pulls up Clara's Citizen Details (Li says she shouldn't have access). Gov't Employee Abuse?
  - Its a citizen database, with same information as was onthe phone but also a map with her current location. Like in a pretty tight area...
  - Karin calls Clara's roommate, somehow getting her number to warn Clara they are on the way.
- Head to Clara, Blue has Rasmus track ADI's in the area. Rasmus has set a trap to try and ID the perp.
- Rasmus detects a breach attempted, trying to trace it. The rest evacuate Clara to a safehouse, realizing the ADI is nearby. The ADI follows them on the car.
- Trace fails, the thousands of ADIs have gone off the grid nearby, now under someone's control.
  - Phones become jammed, can't warn Blue and Karin fully.
  - Rasumus realizes the entire thing has been taken over, he has no control.
  - Swarm of thousands stream towards the house; they take shelter in Bath. Bees working together, eventually killing Clara.
- Bee's dispurse, body taken away.

## 55:00 (Night Day 3)

- Debrief at HQ, Ramsus is there with Karin, Blue, and Li.
  - Bees aren't being steered, too many at once. They are controlling the system
  - Blue: Database determines the basic area isn't enough , which means the visual sensors are being used to distinguish who in the area.
  - Rasmus: The feed is secure from Hive to ADI, but the Gov't requirement for backing the project needed a backdoor to get into the feeds for "times of increase national security".
  - Li knew of this. Classified. They are spying. They do CCTVs and Traffic.
    - Gov't would only fund it if they could get more
    - Prevented bombings and mass shootings by spying, but keeping safe. Except Clara.
- Ramsus is locked out. Blue determined to look inside an ADI.
- Nick comes in with some leads on who would have had access to the ADI systems. Government employee list.

## 60:00 (Morning Day 4)

- Public learns #DeathTo link to murders.
  - News sensationalizing; tracking top 5 up for bat...
  - People blogging on YouTube, expressing either wrongnes of this or egging others to "Make your #DeathTO choice count!!!"
  - "Someone's going to be top of list, why not make it someone who deservces it - like a 'racist'"
  - "People can get away with it since no one knows who did it"
  - How culpable are people?

All at once the following happens:

- Blue inspects the ADI's software contents
  - Finds a manifesto "the teeth of consequences" written by Garrett with a selfie attached
- Karen working on Employee interviews
  - Tess: worked in HR for Granular (ADI company) until she had interviewed someone who she had to threaten arrest over. Turns out the man had a learning disability that caught her huge flack on social media.
  - Tess: "It was like having a whole weather system turn against me, hate after hate." A million invisible people talking about how they dispise you.
  - Admits she made a mistake, but people enjoyed "kicking her"; "casual fun". Attempted suicide. Her flatmate "Garrett" found her bleeding out in the bathtub and kept her alive. Garrett worked at Granular on the ADI team.
- Li meets with the Chancellor who is currently on the top of the list. People are discussing what to do.
  - Chancellor wants to shut down the whole internet, social media, etc - pull a North Korea on it.
  - Li advises against it, he'd still be number one by 5pm.
  - Chancellor wants to leak something to skew the public away from himself.
  - Li wants to move chancellor to safe location, shows live video of army at the Hive. Plan to knock out nearby hives in the safe area.
  - After attempting to blow up the hive, the bees don't die and they kill the soldiers.
  - Can either knock out all hives and kill environment, or take victim a day.

Inspecting the Manifesto:

- Garrett - "Thanks to the technologal revolution we have the power to rage and accuse, but bile without consequence. Only if we recognize the power…" … theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.
- Nick tweets #DeathTo with the picture of Garrett.
- Inspecting the selfie taken, Blue realizes there's a geolocation tag leading them to where Garrett took the photo.
- Garrett sees the tweet from Nick, and flees the scene. Rash, oversharing of information.
  - Inconsistency: Said Garrett left the country 6 months ago, yet they nearly missed him inside the country? Or was this just another ploy to mislead them?
- At Garrett's compound (hidden just outside Granular), Blue finds a burned harddrive in the forge that lets Ramsus regain control.

At Rasmus's Lab:

- 3 minutes left to 5pm. Rasmus has the source to take back control. Noticed a new file.
- It's a list of IMEI numbers. 387,000 numbers. List of all people who used the HashTag. The backdoor allowed Garrett to get this info from the Government DB.
  - That's ~75% of the number of deaths in the UK for all of 2015; in 1 day.
- Nick owns up to posting - he's on it.
- Ramsus is ready to turn off the drones, Li wants to take action now given the Chancellor's life and Karin doesn't: "He left them a trail" Shutting it down could "trigger an endgame, something with the list - the people on the list are his targets" Consequences. The players are the targets.
- Li presses the button against their urge.
  - They regain control of system
  - And then it goes right offline again. End game has been triggered.

Images of the fallout ensues.

- Garrett is changing his identity, dumps all his stuff in a lake - in a foreign country?
- Warehouse of dead bodies
- Karin in court hearing, recounting the events.
- Describes Blue's death several months after, for possibly causing the whole sequence of events by springing his trap. Explains her stuff was found on a beach.
- As Karin leaves court, she recieves message from Blue.
- Blue faked death, ends with her trailing Garret from a Spanish Coffee shop after listening to the hearings.
