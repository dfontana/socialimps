## 00:00
- Karin's Apartment:
  - Keypad locked
  - Lights turn on as she passes
  - Remote control blinds, among other off-screen devices.

## 05:00
- Jo's Apartment:
  - Security camera over door
  - Her computer has very slim bezels, but nothing much more to it.

## 11:00
- Blue looking for Driverless cars to go mainstream, no license
- Karin smokes an e-Cig

## 13:30
- Every car thus far (Karin's and the Cake delivery) has had the electric squeel.

## 15:00
- Blue's laptop has a transparent display from the front (not the back, though). The keyboard is all touch based, no physical keys.

## 19:30
- Karin's Phone: 
  - Older looking (big bezels, bulkier)
  - Can look up an individual on their cellphones, know most things about them. Name, Gender, Bithdate, Place of Birth, ID#, Current City, Occupation, and Company
- Blue's Phone:
  - Slim, very small bezels, semi-transparent from both sides, "look up social feeds"
- Oddly enough, both only have 4G still. Not even LTE.

## 24:00
- Security Cameras at the Performance Venue for Tusk
- MRI machine scans him, accidently killing him.
- ADI: Autonomous Drone Insect, in this case a bee designed to pollinate
  - 29:00 The bees are shown working in sync, like the South Korean Olympic ones.
  - 30:00 They are solar, don't eat, just move from plant to plant brushing pollen from one to one. They have a basic vision sensor with rudimentary pattern recognition to navigate autonomously. Build their own 3D printing Hives to reproduce themselves.

## 35:00
- Swap phone numbers by touching phone screens

## 41:00
- Blue's using FireFox to browse the web. Pocket is still a thing :S
- Citizen Database knowing everything from Karen's phone + current location. Are able to look up related people (like roommates) phone numbers...

## 43:00
- Blue is using a bluetooth ear dongle. So 2000s.
- Their car opens with a remote, there is no driver's seat: its 4 seats facing one another and a large touch screen in the middle to control it. Seats roll around. Brand new cars. Can turn every light green as they move. Eletric. Of course, autopilot.

## 46:00 
Security cameras on top of building watches over the area around Clara's Apt.

## 55:00
- Computer vision for facial recognition in the ADIs
- Government classified surveillance using CCTV, Traffic Cam, and now ADIs

## 60:00
- Blue can wirelessly connect to the drone from a pad. "Pairing". Bluetooth?

## 70:00
- Blue uses a geotag from a photo in the manifesto to find Garrett

# 74:00
- Blue's USB attaches with Magnets. Want. Badly.
