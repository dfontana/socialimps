## Smart Home (Karin's Apartment):
- Timestamps: 00:00, 05:00
- Description: Her apartment features a keypad lock on the front door, lights that turn on as she walks by, and a remote control that can open the blinds as well as turn on other off-screen devices.
- Category: Existing, perhaps as of the last few years especially. 
- Realistic: Some of this tech exists today and is making its way into the home. For example, [this NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/technology/how-to-make-a-smart-home) covers some of the ways the items Karin does in her apartment can be done and more (like voice assistants, or using your phone instead of a remote). I think the big difference expressed in the show is that the attitude towards it is so ubiquitous. Karin treats it all like routine, but today it's still pretty rare/exciting to see someone's home like that. Shortly later in the episode we see Jo's apartment has security cameras - something that is certainly growing popular today with common appliances like the [Nest camera](https://nest.com/cameras/). 

## Driverless, Electric Cars (NCA vehicle, Blue):
- Timestamps: 11:00 & 43:00
- Description: Blue makes an early remark on how she doesn't have a  license, so she's waiting for "driverless to go mainstream." Additionally, all cars in the show are heard making that signature electric vehicle hum (perhaps to an exaggerated extent) - suggesting they may have replaced gas powered vehicles. Finally, the NCA agent's car (Li) is capable of opening its door with a remote; there's no drivers seat; the four seats face one another inside (and swivel); and there is a large touch screen interface in the center that can control a variety of things about the car - in addition to turning every light in between the car and its destination green.
- Category: Some parts are current, others fictional or in progress. For example, driverless vehicles are in progress from Uber, Google, and Tesla (to name a few). Electric vehicles have been around for a while, since the Chevy Volt in 2010. But neither solutions go to the extremes the NCA car can.
- Realistic? Driverless cars from Tesla, Uber, and Google have hit the streets and are clocking hours practicing. They aren't fictional, but they certainly aren't mainstream (as Blue would suggest). What's not so realistic is the pervasiveness of electric vehicles in the show and the extreme extents taken by the NCA car. 
[Ars Technica reports](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/2017-was-the-best-year-ever-for-electric-vehicle-sales-in-the-us/) 200,000 electric vehicles were sold in 2017... while 17 million cars were sold overall. We still have a while to go from where Black Mirror sees yet.
[Concept cars](http://www.businessinsider.com/concept-cars-of-the-future-photos-2016-7#because-the-car-is-driverless-the-steering-wheel-will-retract-back-into-the-dashboard-when-its-not-in-use-16) have shown features similar to the NCA one such as the steering wheel-less approach, swivel chairs, and touch controls; but these are only concepts. The closest thing we have to what the NCA car could do is the ability to "change" lights between the car and its destination. Ambulances and other emergency vehicles, for example, [are able to change lights with a pre-emption device](https://www.tranbc.ca/2014/01/30/5-things-that-make-traffic-signals-change/) when responding to problems.


## 11:00
- Karin smokes an e-Cig


## 15:00
- Blue's laptop has a transparent display from the front (not the back, though). The keyboard is all touch based, no physical keys.
## 41:00
- Blue's using FireFox to browse the web. Pocket is still a thing :S

## 19:30
- Karin's Phone: 
  - Older looking (big bezels, bulkier)
  - Can look up an individual on their cellphones, know most things about them. Name, Gender, Bithdate, Place of Birth, ID#, Current City, Occupation, and Company
- Blue's Phone:
  - Slim, very small bezels, semi-transparent from both sides, "look up social feeds"
- Oddly enough, both only have 4G still. Not even LTE.
## 35:00
- Swap phone numbers by touching phone screens
## 43:00
- Blue is using a bluetooth ear dongle. So 2000s.


## 24:00
- Security Cameras at the Performance Venue for Tusk
- MRI machine scans him, accidently killing him.
- ADI: Autonomous Drone Insect, in this case a bee designed to pollinate
  - 29:00 The bees are shown working in sync, like the South Korean Olympic ones.
  - 30:00 They are solar, don't eat, just move from plant to plant brushing pollen from one to one. They have a basic vision sensor with rudimentary pattern recognition to navigate autonomously. Build their own 3D printing Hives to reproduce themselves.

## 41:00
- Citizen Database knowing everything from Karen's phone + current location. Are able to look up related people (like roommates) phone numbers...


## 46:00 
Security cameras on top of building watches over the area around Clara's Apt.

## 55:00
- Computer vision for facial recognition in the ADIs
- Government classified surveillance using CCTV, Traffic Cam, and now ADIs

## 60:00
- Blue can wirelessly connect to the drone from a pad. "Pairing". Bluetooth?

## 70:00
- Blue uses a geotag from a photo in the manifesto to find Garrett

# 74:00
- Blue's USB attaches with Magnets. Want. Badly.
