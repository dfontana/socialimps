      <title>Intellectual Property</title>
      <link>https://dfontana.github.io/socialimps/topics/intellectualproperty/</link>

      <description>As we covered in class, and the text, Intellectual Property is mostly concerned with ownership of a creation/idea - be it through Copyright, Patents, or Trade Secret. In our movie, the matter at hand is a crisis in social media coupled with cybercrime, privacy, and freedom of speech. As such, this topic is not truly relevant to Black Mirror: Hated in the Nation, as the conflict pursued by the film centers on these other issues it finds more pressing.</description>
