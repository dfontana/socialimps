      <description>Intent Behind Black Mirror Black Mirror, created by Charlie Brooker, is a series of variable length television episodes exploring the darker side of society&amp;rsquo;s connections with technology. Each episode is independent of the others, set in the &amp;ldquo;alternative present or near future&amp;rdquo;, with a different story and intent. Brooker describes the &amp;ldquo;black mirror&amp;rdquo; referenced to in the title as &amp;ldquo;the one you&amp;rsquo;ll find on every wall, on every desk, in the palm of every hand: the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitor, a smartphone&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Intellectual Property</title>

      <description>As we covered in class, and the text, Intellectual Property is mostly concerned with ownership of a creation/idea - be it through Copyright, Patents, or Trade Secret. In our movie, the matter at hand is a crisis in social media coupled with cybercrime, privacy, and freedom of speech. As such, this topic is not truly relevant to Black Mirror: Hated in the Nation, as the conflict pursued by the film centers on these other issues it finds more pressing.</description>
