    <ul>
      <li> Blue - "Phones absorb us. Know everything we are."</li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>
      High-tech company bankrolled by the Gov't to build the ADI's. They are paranoids the Goven't are spying on them with it. Statue in the lobby are a bunch of the ADIs working in unison. Kinda like the olympics at Korea.
    </li>
  </ul>

  30 - 34 mins
  <ul>
    <li>ADIs</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Colony Collapse Disorder - they don't know what's behind it, so they built the ADIs as a means to fill in the gaps</li>
      <li>They are autonomous with no control - they set the behavior and go for it</li>
      <li>They reproduce - they build hives themselves where they act as 3D printers to make more</li>
      <li>They have a rudimentary vision sensor to help navigate</li>
      <li>"These are not designed to kill someone" "When they malfunction they just break and hit the ground"</li>
      <li>To hack it you'd need a diagnostic tool that's encrypted and its got military grade encryption.</li>
      <li>They can see every hive they have online - so they know where the hives are</li>
      <li>4,000 per hive. It's like an aircraft control.</li>
      <li>Bees pathing is logged, can replay.</li>
      <li>Has to be within a 20 meter radius</li>
      <li>Can swap phone numbers by tapping phones</li>
      <li>Can't shutdown the bees within environment issues and needs approval from Gov't.</li>

    <li>Blue's laptop has a touchscreen keyboard, see through screen.</li>
    <li>HashTag sent from bot account started the murder tweet - seed the tag. They wanted people to pickup on it.</li>
    <li>"Game of Consequences" - pick someone you don't like, pick enough and that's who they target.</li>
  </ul>

  41 Mins
  <ul>
    <li>Pulling citizens details - can look up someone's location. You're not supposed to have access to it, but bleu does. Gov't employee abuse.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Next victim watching the tweet roll in, freaking out.</li>
      <li>Her roommate has no idea how the police have her number.</li>
      <li>Car door has remotes to open it. Touch screen controller. Seats roll around</li>
      <li>Can turn all lights green in their path for the super car. Its auto pilot, just got to tell it where to go on</li>

    <li>CEO running tracer on it the rogue bee.</li>
    <li>Bee followed to house on their car</li>
    <li>Can't trace it - Ramsus (CEO guy)… Whole hive just went down. Thousands of them. Close to their location.</li>
    <li>Their phones are being jammed. Entire colony has been taken over. Across the entire country.</li>
    <li>Huge death swarm inbound.</li>
    <li>Trapped inside the bath. The bees are working together to get through the door & vents.</li>
    <li>Killed the victim, now they sit in the bathroom surrounded unsure of what is to come next.</li>
  </ul>

  55 Mins
  <ul>
    <li>Turns out it's not a radius, someone can control the entire system.</li>
    <li>The ID Database gives the basic area, but how did they know who to target?</li>
    <li>Facial recognition is built in</li>
    <li>The government forced the company to let a backdoor in so they could watch surveil the entire public.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>It protected the public by spying on suspects</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  60 Mins
  <ul>
    <li>People know they are dying but people are still taking part - they are getting insane over it</li>
    <li>Since people can jump on board without anyone knowing they did it - they do it. Anonymity.</li>
    <li>News is reporting it like it’s a "top5 race"</li>
    <li>Chancellor: Shut the whole media down - the whole internet - pull a North Korea on it.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>He wants to leak a doc to throw someone under the bus in front of him.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  1:04
  <ul>
    <li>Victim brought in for questioning</li>
    <li>It was like a weather system circling over you, 1 million invisible people talking about how they despise you. Like a mental illness. The way people enjoyed kicking / fun they had. Felt like she couldn't go on. Tried to kill herself. Someone found her and saved her</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The one who saved her - Garret. He put a manifesto in 'the drones "the teeth of consequences"</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  1:08
  <ul>
    <li>After attempting to blow up a hive, the bees attack the soldiers and kill them.</li>
    <li>Ecological disaster if the bees go away, controlling murders if kept around.</li>
    <li>Garrett - "Thanks to the technologal revolution we have the power to rage and accuse, but bile without consequence. Only if we recognize the power…" … theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediately one of the agents goes and tweets #DeathTo Garrett and posts his image. Hesitates on doing it, but then does it. Playing right into the point…</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Phone left a geotag on the selfie he took. They found out he is outside granular HQ</li>
    <li>Garrett learns the police are after him due to the agent's tweet…….</li>
    <ul>
      <li>He gets away….</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  1:13
  <ul>
    <li>Burned a harddrive in a forge. Lets Ramsus get back into the system.</li>
    <li>USBs connect via magnets.</li>
    <li>IMEI - unique user ID. The drive contains a list of everyone who has used the HashTag. The Backdoor let them get the list of details on the people from the government's DB.</li>
    <li>Karen - what if the list is the real targets, those who took part. The players are the targets. "Consequences."</li>
    <li>The NSA guy runs the deactivate script, supposed to regain control. But it's not a recontrol script. It’s the trap.</li>
  </ul>

  1:17
  <ul>
    <li>The hive mobilizes… In position for mass murder.</li>
    <li>Garrett is somewhere remote, packing? Stripping. Shaving completely? Changes his eye color with contacts. Dumps his stuff into a lake after filling it with rocks.</li>
  </ul>

  1:22 
  <ul>
    <li>Aftermath. Warehouse. Just a huge warehouse of the dead.</li>
    <li>Blue blamed herself, felt she sprung it all. Left the force, went MIA, and found her things 4 months later on a beach with a note. She had committed suicide - in theory.</li>
    <li>Garrett watching the hearings from a coffee shop? Spanish country</li>
    <li>Blue not dead, but tracked down garrett. Suicide was staged.</li>
  </ul>

  1:27
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ends with Blue tailing garret.
